# MiniFlow

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/shtakai/mini-flow.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

Miniflow is a neural network library I built from scratch. MiniFlow, behaves much like TensorFlow, Google's deep learning library.

My objective to start this project was to demistify neural networks and the concepts assosciated with it such as backpropagation and differentiable graphs.

Backpropagation is the process by which neural networks update the weights of the network over time.

Differentiable graphs are graphs where the nodes are differentiable functions. They are also useful as visual aids for understanding and calculating complicated derivatives. This is the fundamental abstraction of TensorFlow - it's a framework for creating differentiable graphs.
